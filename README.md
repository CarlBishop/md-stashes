- **STEP 1**
Drag Resource into your script folder

<h1>How It Works</h1>
You can either 


A) type out manually where you want the stashes 

or 

B) use command newstash and fill in the things you want
if you do not want an option LEAVE BLANK
for example. if you dont want the stash job locked, leave the job category blank.
when you hit enter it will copy the code and you paste it in your config then badaboom badabing it Works
